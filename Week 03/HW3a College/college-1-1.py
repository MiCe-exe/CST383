CST 383, Homework 3.

In this homework we use Pandas to investigate a data set about 
college majors.  The data is from 2010-2012, and was derived
from US Census data by an Ben Casselman of fivethirtyeight.com

"""

"""

Info about the data set.

Here is the data:
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors

Here is Casselman's report:
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/

This data set concerns people under 28 who have
a bachelor's degree but no graduate degree.  The data comes
from the US Census PUMS data, which is a statistical sample of the 
US census data.  

Information about the columns in the data set can be found on the
github page listed above.  It's hard to interpret some of this data.  
For example, unemployed + employed does not equal total.  From the R 
script Casselman wrote to generate his data set, this is what I understand:
    
Total: total number of people for the major (in the census data)
  
Median: median yearly income for those in the major

Full_time_year_round: 50+ weeks/year, 35+ hours/week.
  
Employed:
    - employed means employment status code is either
       - civilian employed, at work
       - civilian employed, with a job but not at work
         (this means the person does not happen to be at work that day, for
          reasons including vacation, illness, bad weather, strike, etc.)
    - note that this can be part-time work, or even erratic work, I guess
    
Unemployed: census employment status code is 'unemployed'
    - Employed + Unemployed does give give the total for the major, because
      there are other categories, like 'not in labor force', and 'armed forces'

Full_time: avg hours/week > 35 in last 12 months 

Part-time: average hours/week over past 12 months was non-zero, but less than 35 hours.
   - Note that Full_time + Part_time gives total number of people who
     worked over the past 12 months, but does not give the same value
     as Employed.
         
College jobs, Non_college_jobs, Low_wage_jobs:  These are related to
  certain lists of jobs, and if you add the values together, you don't
  get all job.  Casselman doesn't show exactly which jobs these are.

Homework instructions:
    
PLEASE NOTE: your code will be graded automatically so please
follow these instructions carefully.  My grading script grades
each of your answers *independently*.  In other words, I do not
run all of your submitted code in order.  I take your code for
one problem, and run it in an environment where certain variables
or functions are defined.  For each problem I will list the 
variables you can assume to be defined in your answer.  Do not
assume that variables or functions that you defined earlier are
available.

In your code for a problem, you can define temporary methods and
variables before your final line of code, but you cannot assume
these temporary methods are available in later problems.
I will run your code on a modified version of the dataset to make
sure it gets the right answers if the data is a little different.

Also, please note that you should not use a loop anywhere in your code
for this homework.
